# Dynamic-Memory-Allocation
2016 Computer Programming Lesson Final project

# Summary

In C, dynamic memory is allocated from the heap using some standard library functions. The two key dynamic memory functions are malloc() and free(). The malloc() function takes a single parameter, which is the size of the requested memory area in bytes. It returns a pointer to the allocated memory.
